## Goals
The goal of this project is to provide a kitchen where the user is cook, and
the power user is chef.

Live your life in a read-write world of Linked Data.

Use all your solid Pods, including your local files as your zero-th Pod.
Bring in all the stuff in your life shared by friends and colleagues.
Bring in public data, like DBPedia, Wikidata and the LOD cloud.

Things to test it on:

 - `http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Seely_Brown`

 - a local Turtle file on your computer with a URI starting with `file:///`

 - your own WebID
